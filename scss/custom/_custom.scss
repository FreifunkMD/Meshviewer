// Example of overwriting variables. Take a look at modules/variables
// .node-links {
//    color: $color-primary;
// }

// You can also include additional files for style example https://github.com/ffrgb/meshviewer/tree/ffrgb-config/scss/custom
// Include syntax: @include "name" -> Filename: _name.scss

// SCSS supports css with a lot of additional features like variables or mixins.
// Autoprefixer runs in postcss, no need to add browser-prefixes like -webkit, -moz or -ms
